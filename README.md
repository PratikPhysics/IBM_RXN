## 🚀 Overview

Chemists and researchers often work with detailed experimental procedures written in natural language. This tool leverages **IBM RXN’s AI models** to convert such text into structured **reaction protocol steps**.

For example, given a paragraph describing a synthesis process, the app identifies and lists individual lab actions (e.g., *“Add 5 mL of ethanol,” “Stir for 30 minutes,” “Filter the solution”*, etc.).
